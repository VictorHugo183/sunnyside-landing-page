This is a solution to the [Sunnyside agency landing page challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/sunnyside-agency-landing-page-7yVs3B6ef)

## The challenge:

The challenge is to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## Built with:

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Media queries
- ES6
- Desktop-first workflow

## Where to find everything:

- Design specifications inside the `/design` folder. You will find both a mobile and a desktop version of the design.

- All the required assets are in the `/images` folder. The assets are already optimized.

- There is also a `style-guide.md` file containing the information provided, such as color palette, fonts and screen dimentions.
